Library Management System using Spring Boot

Project Description

This project builds a robust and secure Library Management System API using Spring Boot. It empowers librarians to seamlessly manage books, patrons, and borrowing records, enhancing library operations.

Key Features

CRUD Operations:
Create, read, update, and delete books, patrons, and borrowing records.
RESTful API Endpoints:
Books:
GET /api/books - Retrieves all books.
GET /api/books/{id} - Fetches a specific book by ID.
POST /api/books - Creates a new book.
PUT /api/books/{id} - Updates an existing book's information.
DELETE /api/books/{id} - Removes a book from the library.
Patrons:
GET /api/patrons - Retrieves all registered patrons.
GET /api/patrons/{id} - Fetches details of a specific patron by ID.
POST /api/patrons - Registers a new patron in the system.
PUT /api/patrons/{id} - Updates existing patron information.
DELETE /api/patrons/{id} - Removes a patron from the system.
Borrowing:
POST /api/borrow/{bookId}/patron/{patronId} - Records a patron borrowing a book.
PUT /api/return/{bookId}/patron/{patronId} - Tracks the book's return by the patron.
Data Persistence:
Leverages a robust database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for storing book, patron, and borrowing record details.
Meticulously defines relationships between entities for efficient data management (e.g., one-to-many between books and borrowing records).
Validation and Error Handling:
Implements rigorous input validation for API requests to enforce data integrity.
Handles exceptions gracefully, returning informative error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes.
Security (Optional):
Offers an extra layer of protection through basic authentication or JWT-based authorization (consider implementing for enhanced security).
Optional Extensions (For Advanced Customization):

Logging:
Employs Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to log method calls, exceptions, and performance metrics for book operations, patron transactions, and similar critical functionalities.
Caching:
Utilizes Spring's caching capabilities to cache frequently accessed book details or patron information, boosting system performance.
Transaction Management:
Integrates declarative transaction management using Spring's @Transactional annotation to ensure data consistency during crucial operations like book updates, patron registrations, and borrowing/returning of books.
Testing

Unit Testing:
Embraces unit tests written using JUnit, Mockito, or SpringBootTest to thoroughly validate the functionality of API endpoints and core components.
Documentation

Provides crystal-clear documentation encompassing:
Instructions for running the application.
Guidance on interacting with API endpoints, including authentication methods (if applicable).
Refer to the docs folder or designated sections within the code for detailed documentation.
Evaluation Criteria

Functionality:
Rigorously tests CRUD operations for books, patrons, and borrowing records to ensure flawless execution.
Code Quality:
Emphasizes readable, maintainable, and well-structured code that adheres to best practices.
Error Handling:
Comprehensively assesses the handling of edge cases and validation errors to guarantee system robustness.
Testing:
Evaluates the thoroughness and effectiveness of the implemented unit tests.
Bonus:
Credits are awarded for the inclusion of extra features like authorization, transactions, caching, and aspect-oriented logging.
